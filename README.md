# Lab X: Work Log
## April 9th 2021
-Went to the Nasa apod-api repository and started on the logging. 

## April 15th 2021
9:30pm - 11:30mp 
- Change my approach and started from scratch.
- Created a ps1 file to get the Image of the day, used same format from Lab 8. 
- Was able to make it my background
  - Had trouble with this part, I found out I had to include multuple lines of "RUNDLL32.EXE USER32.DLL,UpdatePerUserSystemParameters ,1 ,True" until it would make it my background.

10:30am - 11:30am
- Started a py file to create the database part of the lab, used same format from Lab 3.
- Was able to finish the date and time, name and size of file.

1:30pm - 4pm
- Finished gtting the sha256 hash part of the database
  - This was tough, I was only getting the hash of the py file and not of the image but after a while I figured it out with some extra research.
